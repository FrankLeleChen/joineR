Description: Analysis of repeated measurements and time-to-event data via random
    effects joint models. Fits the joint models proposed by Henderson and colleagues
    <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/1.4.465> (single event time) and by Williamson and
    colleagues (2008) <doi:10.1002/sim.3451> (competing risks events time) to a
    single countinuous repeated measure. The time-to-event data is modelled using a 
    (cause-specific) Cox proportional hazards regression model with time-varying 
    covariates. The longitudinal outcome is modelled using a linear mixed effects
    model. The association is captured by a multivariate latent Gaussian process.
    The model is estimated using a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization algorithm.
    Some plotting functions and the variogram are also included. This project is
